# NIFTY50 Minute-by-Minute Price & Return Prediction using LSTM

This project uses a pre-trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the minute-by-minute closing prices and returns for the NIFTY50 index. It focuses on the most recent 60 minutes of available data, making predictions iteratively for each minute.

## Features

* Loads NIFTY50 historical minute-level data from a CSV file.
* Utilizes a pre-trained LSTM model and a corresponding data scaler.
* Processes the most recent data (last 2 days, focusing on the final 60 minutes for prediction).
* Predicts:
  * Next minute's closing price.
  * Next minute's log return.
  * Next minute's percentage return.
* Compares predictions against actual values for the last 60 minutes.
* Calculates performance metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for log returns.
* Visualizes:
  * Predicted vs. Actual Log Returns.
  * Predicted vs. Actual Percentage Returns.
  * Predicted vs. Actual Prices.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Google Colab environment (or a local environment with appropriate modifications for file paths and library installations).
* Libraries:
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * joblib
  * tensorflow
  * matplotlib
  * scikit-learn
  * google-colab (if running in Colab)
You can install these (if not in Colab) using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas joblib tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Setup

1. **Google Drive:**
  * Ensure you have a Google Account and access to Google Drive.
  * Create a folder structure in your Google Drive, for example: MyDrive/LSTM/lstm_returns/.
  * Upload the following files to the specified paths (or adjust paths in the script):
  * **NIFTY50 Data CSV:** /content/drive/MyDrive/LSTM/NIFTY50.csv
  * **Pre-trained LSTM Model:** /content/drive/MyDrive/LSTM/lstm_returns/lstm_minute_csv_20250518_25y.h5
  * **Pre-trained Scaler:** /content/drive/MyDrive/LSTM/lstm_returns/scaler_minute_csv_25y.pkl
2. **Data Format (NIFTY50.csv):**
  * The CSV file should contain historical minute-level data for NIFTY50.
  * It **must** have a datetime column. The script attempts to find it under names: Datetime, datetime, Date, or date.
  * It **must** have a closing price column. The script attempts to find it under names: Close, close, or falls back to the 4th column (index 3) if these are not found.
  * The data should be sorted chronologically, though the script includes a sort step.
  * To perform predictions for the last 60 minutes, the CSV should contain at least the last 2 days of data, with at least 61 data points (minutes) in the most recent segment.
Example CSV structure (minimum required columns):
```
Datetime,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume
2023-10-26 09:15:00,19000.50,19010.20,18990.00,19005.75,100000
2023-10-26 09:16:00,19005.75,19015.80,19002.30,19012.40,120000
...
```
Use code with caution.

## Usage

* Open the Python script (.ipynb or .py) in Google Colab.
* Ensure your Google Drive is organized as per the Setup section, or update the file paths in the script:
  * csv_filename
  * model_path
  * scaler_path
* Run all cells in the notebook.
* When prompted, authorize Google Colab to access your Google Drive.
* The script will:
  * Load and preprocess the data.
  * Load the model and scaler.
  * Perform minute-by-minute predictions for the last 60 minutes.
  * Print the final predicted vs. actual price and performance metrics (MAE, MSE).
  * Display three plots showing predicted vs. actual log returns, percentage returns, and prices.
## Script Overview
* **Imports & Setup:** Imports necessary libraries and mounts Google Drive.
* **Data Loading & Preprocessing:**
  * Loads the NIFTY50 CSV.
  * Converts the date/time column to datetime objects and sets it as the index.
  * Sorts the data by time.
  * Filters the DataFrame to include only data from the last 2 days to optimize processing for the final 60-minute window.
  * Ensures a 'close' column exists (or derives it).
  * Calculates percentage 'Returns'.
  * Selects the last 61 data points (to allow for 60 predictions, as each prediction uses the prior minute's data).
* **Model Loading:** Loads the pre-trained LSTM model and the MinMax scaler.
* **Prediction Loop:**
  * Iterates through the selected 60-minute window (from the 2nd minute to the 61st).
  * For each minute i:
    * Takes the 'close' price and 'Returns' from the previous minute (i-1) as input.
    * Scales this input using the loaded scaler.
    * Reshapes the input for the LSTM model.
    * Predicts the scaled next minute's value (interpreted as a component related to price movement).
    * Inverse transforms the prediction to get an estimated "predicted price". Note: The model was likely trained to predict returns or price changes, so the inverse transform uses a placeholder for the 'Returns' feature to isolate the 'price' component.
    * Calculates predicted log return and percentage return based on this predicted_price and the prev_close.
    * Stores actual and predicted prices, log returns, and percentage returns.
* **Metrics Calculation:** Computes MAE and MSE between actual and predicted log returns.
* **Output & Plotting:**
  * Prints the final predicted vs. actual price for the last minute.
  * Prints the calculated MAE and MSE.
  * Generates and displays plots for log returns, percentage returns, and prices.
## Pre-trained Model & Scaler
Model (lstm_minute_csv_20250518_25y.h5): This is a Keras LSTM model. It was presumably trained on historical NIFTY50 minute data, likely using 'close' prices and 'Returns' as input features to predict future price movements or returns.
Scaler (scaler_minute_csv_25y.pkl): This is a joblib-saved MinMaxScaler (or similar) from scikit-learn. It was fitted on the same features ('close', 'Returns') that the LSTM model was trained on and is necessary to transform new input data into the range the model expects.
